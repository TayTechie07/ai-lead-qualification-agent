## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a simple yet effective **AI Lead Qualification Agent** that simulates how AI agents process user input, reason over it, and produce actionable outputs.

The agent evaluates a lead message, assigns an intent score, explains the reasoning behind the decision, and suggests an appropriate response.

## 🧠 What This Agent Does

- Accepts a lead message as user input
- Analyzes the message using keyword-based NLP logic
- Assigns an intent level: **High, Medium, or Low**
- Generates a confidence score
- Explains the reasoning behind the classification
- Suggests a context-aware reply

## ⚙️ Agent Workflow (Step-by-Step)

1. **User Input**  
   The user pastes a lead message into the system.

2. **Intent Analysis**  
   The agent scans the message for predefined keywords related to business intent.

3. **Scoring Mechanism**  
   Each relevant keyword contributes to an overall intent score.

4. **Decision Logic**  
   The score is mapped to an intent level:
   - High Intent
   - Medium Intent
   - Low Intent

5. **Reasoning Explanation**  
   The agent explains why the lead was assigned a specific intent level.

6. **Response Generation**  
   A suitable reply is generated based on the intent classification.
